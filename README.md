# Welcome to Prediction of Interest in Vehicle Insurance
In this project, I predict the data with some classification machine learning models.  

# Background
This dataset contains existing customers in insurance company in last year. 
They like to offerung existing customers with their vehicle insurance product.
But, they don't know who are interesting, so they need team data help to predict whether customers interet or not in vehicle insurance.

# Objective
Gain insight from data features in order to help company get better understanding in their customers dataset. 
And then, doing machine learning models classification to predict customers who have interest in vehicle insurance

# Result Preview
The models are achieving 86% by AUC score in predicting train data, and 85% in predicting in test data. 
The model is fit and can use in dataset company.
We also give some recomendation about some features that have big affect in interesting customers in vehicle insurance.
